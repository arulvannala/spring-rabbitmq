Spring RabbitMQ
===============

This project contains an example for using Spring-Boot with RabbitMQ. The idea is to have a single exchange *E* with multiple queues *Q_1 ... Q_n* for multiple Routing Keys *K_1 ... K_m* (mind that the number of queues can be different from the number of routing keys). The example allows dynamic registration of message consumers / workers *W_1 ... W_p* such that:

* Workers only need to know the name of the exchange *E* and the routing key *K* they are interested in
* Messages tagged with a routing key *K* are distributed to all queues that are registered at the exchange for this routing key
* Arbitrary workers *W_1 ... W_i* can form a worker pool that is bound to a single queue *Q_j*
* A message is processed by exactly one worker registered at a single queue
* Workers can be added and removed to a queue at runtime with no changes in configuration at the producer side



Prerequisites
-------------

* Install a local [RabbitMQ server](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-standalone-mac.html)
  * RabbitMQ [config file](https://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html) is expected in `/usr/local/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config` (go to Web UI to see the path on Windows machines)
* Start RabbitMQ with `rabbitmq-server`
  * RabbitMQ UI will be available at [http://localhost:15672/] afterwards



Building and Running the Application
------------------------------------

Either with

* Run `mvn package`
* Run `java -jar target/rabbitconsumer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

or simply

* `mvn spring-boot:run`

If you want to change the application multiple times with different ports, use `mvn spring-boot:run -Dserver.port=8090`



Using the Application
---------------------

The application provides two resources:

1. A message producer under [http://localhost:8080/producer](http://localhost:8080/producer)
1. A message consumer under [http://localhost:8080/consumer](http://localhost:8080/consumer)

### Registering a Consumer

For registering a new consumer, send a POST request to the following URL [localhost:8080/consumer/register/{consumerID}/{queueName}/{routingKey}](localhost:8080/consumer/register/{consumerID}/{queueName}/{routingKey})

Corresponding CURL command:

    curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/consumer/register/{consumerID}/{queueName}/{routingKey}"

### Sending POST Requests to Producer

This will send a new message to the queue. A message has a *messageType* which corresponds to the routing key and a *messageBody*.

For adding a message to the queue, send a POST request to the following URL [http://localhost:8080/producer](http://localhost:8080/producer).

Here's the "settings" for sending a POST request with Postman:

![Sending Post Request with Postman](/doc/screen-1.png?raw=true "Sending Post Request with Postman")

Corresponding CURL command:

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"-d '{"messageType" : "routingKey", "messageBody" : "Here comes the content"}' "http://localhost:8080/producer"

### Getting a Consumption Log

For getting a log of consumed messages, send a GET request to [http://localhost:8080/consumer](http://localhost:8080/consumer).

Corresponding CURL command:

    curl -X GET -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" -H "Postman-Token: 13678ff4-982e-1f5e-5842-00fdb2fe5d69" "http://localhost:8080/consumer"

The output looks like this:

    [
      "Started Logger",
      "2016/04/15 13:50:28 --- [consumer1]  dl 1",
      "2016/04/15 13:50:28 --- [consumer2]  dl 1",
      "2016/04/15 13:50:33 --- [consumer1]  dl 2",
      "2016/04/15 13:50:33 --- [consumer2]  dl 2",
      ...
    ]

The format is `"TIME --- [CONSUMER_ID]  MESSAGE_CONTENT"`



Usage Example
-------------

1. Start the application with `mvn spring-boot:run`
1. Register 4 consumers in 2 pools:
  * POST localhost:8080/consumer/register/pool1-consumer1/queue1/key1
  * POST localhost:8080/consumer/register/pool1-consumer2/queue1/key1
  * POST localhost:8080/consumer/register/pool2-consumer1/queue2/key1
  * POST localhost:8080/consumer/register/pool2-consumer2/queue2/key1
1. Send the following messages
  * POST http://localhost:8080/producer `{"messageType" : "key1", "messageBody" : "message 1"}`
  * POST http://localhost:8080/producer `{"messageType" : "key1", "messageBody" : "message 2"}`
  * POST http://localhost:8080/producer `{"messageType" : "key1", "messageBody" : "message 3"}`
  * POST http://localhost:8080/producer `{"messageType" : "key1", "messageBody" : "message 4"}`
1. Check the consumer log - this should result in

````
[
  "Started Logger",
  "2016/04/15 14:25:15 --- [pool1-consumer1]  message 1",
  "2016/04/15 14:25:15 --- [pool2-consumer1]  message 1",
  "2016/04/15 14:25:24 --- [pool2-consumer2]  message 2",
  "2016/04/15 14:25:24 --- [pool1-consumer2]  message 2",
  "2016/04/15 14:25:29 --- [pool1-consumer1]  message 3",
  "2016/04/15 14:25:29 --- [pool2-consumer1]  message 3",
  "2016/04/15 14:25:34 --- [pool1-consumer2]  message 4",
  "2016/04/15 14:25:34 --- [pool2-consumer2]  message 4"
]
